    "dialogue3":"Hey what do you think you're doing? You want a weapon? You could've just asked. But before you do, how about we test out your sword skills with a friendly duel?",
    "dialogue2":"King Berengar was such a great King, he was always so involved in our lives, a genuine and kind man. He would listen to his subjects no matter their status, he really cared about all citizens under his rule. But not anymore.. now he's locked away in his keep, and will not let anyone inside. It's like this castle took on a mind of it's own.. the dead began to come alive, and the living unable to die. Those who were able to leave in time... they suffered the worst fate of all. As soon you step foot outside the castle walls your mind is completely lost while your body slowly begins to rot, now they roam the world aimlessly feasting on other human's flesh, never to be satisfied.",
    "dialogue1":"This castle used to be a beacon of hope, now it's filled with dread. But that was years ago, it's hard to remember what life was like before all of this...madness.",

    "dialogue1":"This room has hosted some of the grandest parties the kingdom has ever known.  Indeed, years and years of delightful memories I have had here.  Now its just a vacant, lifeless room.  Kind of sounds like my soul! hah! ehhem..... Folks don't come around here anymore, ever since the old king lost his wits.  Shame, I tell ya! By my troth, the king used to be a honorable and respected man!"

    "dialogue1":"Look, I'm very busy, I have read every book at least 10,038... *closes book* okay make that 10,039 times, and I am still not any closer to figuring out a cure for this treacherous curse.",
    "dialogue2":"If you want to go down to the dungeon you will need a key. But I don't have it! I hid it away! Isn't it already bad enough I have to be near the entrance? Why would I want to let whatever is down there up here? It's locked for a reason.. death, death and more death... no thank you. I mean it's almost as bad as the ballroom, too many people and not enough books, that is the LAST place I would want to be right now. The only benefit of the ballroom is that if you hide something there they wouldn't think to bring it here. Ballroom people and libraries just don't mix."},
